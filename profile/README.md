# Nucleus


**The modern game panel alternative**

Nucleus is a next-generation game server management panel built from the ground up to be faster, more intuitive, and more powerful than traditional solutions. If you've used Pterodactyl, Puffer, or CubeCoders, you'll feel right at home—just with a significantly better experience.

## Why we built Nucleus

Most game panels feel stuck in the past. They're complex when they should be simple, slow when they should be fast, and frustrating when they should just work. We created Nucleus because we believe managing game servers shouldn't require a PhD in system administration.

Nucleus brings modern web technologies and thoughtful UX design to game server management. Whether you're running a single server for friends or managing infrastructure for hundreds of clients, Nucleus scales with your needs without the complexity.

## What makes it different

**Modern interface**  
Built with contemporary web technologies that you'd actually want to use. Clean, fast, and intuitive.

**Performance focused**  
Every aspect is optimized for speed. From API responses to the dashboard, everything just feels snappy.

**Actually easy to use**  
Setup takes minutes, not hours. The interface makes sense. Documentation is clear. It just works.

**Secure by default**  
Enterprise-grade security isn't optional—it's built into every layer of Nucleus.

**Complete control**  
Self-hosted means your data stays yours. No vendor lock-in, no subscriptions, no compromises.
